## [Verse 1]
Monday morning alarm clock screamin' in my ear
Boss man callin' while I'm still drinkin' my beer
Another meeting 'bout synergy and growth
I'd rather set myself on fire than hear both
Your inspirational quotes on Instagram
Make me wanna throw my phone in the dam
Got a text from my ex sayin' "let's be friends"
That's where this conversation ends, 'cause it's a

## [Pre-chorus]
Hard pass, no thanks, not today
I'm walkin' my own way
You can keep your drama and your nine-to-five charade

## [Chorus]
Oh hells no, oh hells no
I ain't doin' what you're tellin' me to do
Oh hells no, oh hells no
Take your expectations and shove 'em with the truth
That I'm broken, outspoken, middle finger to the ceiling
This is my life, I'm stealin' back the feeling
Oh hells no, oh-oh-oh hells no

## [Verse 2]
Dinner with your parents, talkin' politics and wine
Uncle Joe's conspiracy theories blow my mind
Another wedding invitation, plus one too
Sorry, I got better things to do
Like sleepin' till the afternoon in my ripped up jeans

Oh hells no, oh hells no
Take your expectations and shove 'em with the truth
That I'm broken, outspoken, middle finger to the ceiling
This is my life, I'm stealin' back the feeling
Oh hells no, oh-oh-oh hells no

## [Bridge]
[Emotional Bridge building to climax]
I used to say "yes" to everything they threw
Lost myself tryin' to please all of you
But now I'm takin' back my power, takin' back my time
Drawin' lines in the sand, makin' what's mine
You can call me selfish, call me rude
But I'm done bein' everybody's fool

Oh hells no, oh hells no
I ain't doin' what you're tellin' me to do
Oh hells no, oh hells no
Take your expectations and shove 'em with the truth
That I'm broken, outspoken, middle finger to the ceiling
This is my life, I'm stealin' back the feeling
Oh hells no, oh-oh-oh hells no

Oh hells no! (Oh hells no!)
Oh hells no! (Oh hells no!)
